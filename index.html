Dragonfly: You have found a way out of the illusion of time. Now you are witness for your race. 

(Player): 
  - (This can’t be real. How are you doing this?)
  - (Please leave me alone.)
  - (Who are you?)

Dragonfly: (Answer to 2/3) – You cannot get away from your own shadow. 

(Player): Repeat 1

Dragonfly: But it is. This is occurring through means far beyond your Y2K world. 

(Player): But how do I know that any of this is real? 

Dragonfly: Here’s a start. This man, Layne Thompson. (Link)
