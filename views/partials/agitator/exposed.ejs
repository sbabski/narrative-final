  >>>The Agitator has obtained audio records from the Prometheus program that reveal several heinous violations of human rights committed by Prometheus staff. The following clip is an audio log recorded by the program’s head scientist, Alfred Fletcher, in 1999, during the project’s early stages. The log details experiments performed on a test subject named Ray Morgan:<<<

  [Transcript of interview]<br><em>"Yeah, yeah, so I was with my boy D-Dog down in Hamilton Heights, we were there to pass some product off to a regular customer. We were just laying in the cut, y’know, just waiting for the dude to get there. Suddenly 5-0 shows up . . . one of those creepy masked dudes. Just one of them though, and he looked hurt. Bullet holes all in his back and shit, stumbling down the alley. When he looked at me I reached for the strap, y’know, instinctually, but when he saw that dude flipped. Charged at me like a wild animal, his injuries didn’t even seem to affect him. I let off a few shots as he came at me *pop pop pop!!* and he just fell. Looked dead forreal this time. After a sec I took his mask off . . . I really just wanted to see what these dudes look like. He looked awful, pale, cheeks sunken in. Had some weird symbol tatooed under his eye too. But this wasn’t no gang shit, this looked like a brand, yknow? My boy D-Dog wanted his vest and coat for himself, so he took it off him. This dude was ripped underneath, totally wild muscles. I didn’t envy him though, shits was freakishly huge, didn’t look human. His body started rotting away real quick too, like within minutes. I’ve been to a funeral or two in my lifetime, and even my old granny wasn’t that decayed in her casket. We dipped out there fast, man, we still don’t like to talk about it."</em>

  >>>Electroshock therapy, injections, restraints, and tasers? The Agitator staff isn’t exactly surprised to hear that the state is using these barbaric methods, but we are horrified. If this kind of brutality was part of the Prometheus program from the beginning, we fully suspect these tactics are still being used to produce and indoctrinate new Prometheus-enhanced police. We hope these new revelations will help wake the people up. You can count on us to continue unraveling this grisly experiment, and get out on the streets and show the government what we think of their crimes.<<<
