            <p>While zero can be seen to denote nothingness and the absence of all things, it at the same time symbolizes that very primordial infinity from which all form emerges and exists within. In this same way it represents the egg; Birth. Dually it could also symbolize the dissolve back into emptiness; Death. The cyclical balance of birth-death is contained within zero. In Taoism it is taught that zero is equal with Tao.  In Hebrew Kabbalah zero symbolizes the Kabbalist’s “aim”, the boundless, limitless “light”.  Before the One there is only Void, or non-being; thought; the ultimate mystery, the incomprehensible Absolute. Begins with meanings such as, Non-existence; nothingness; the unmanifest; the unlimited; the eternal. The absence of all quality or quantity.</p>

            <p>One symbolizes archaic form, unity, the “creator”, the “unmoved mover”, the monad, the primal unity of all things before their distillation into diversity. Individuality, will power, and creative spirit are all symbolized by the number one. The internal flame of human power is often associated with the number one and therefore the ancient Greek figure of Prometheus is considered a figure of unity. The blind, unrealized energy from zero “comes into form” with the number one.</p>

            <p>Two symbolizes dualities; male and female, dark and light, hot and cold, night and day, etc.. Here the form of one diverges from its unity for the sake of existing and becomes these primal dualities. In this way two can be seen as the number of disillusionment, for it is with dualities that the illusion of opposites emerge. The Pythagoreans viewed two as a cursed number, unlucky, and evocative of the underworld.</p>

            <p>Three represents masculinity, discernment, rationality, and intellectual coolness. The Christian trinity of father, son, and holy spirit is a prevailing symbol of threeness. However, as it is not a natural expression of wholeness, it can also be taken to represent repression, and to an extent, ignorance. Common to Christianity, three could be seen to represent a kind of hyper-masculinity, therefore leading to a patriarchal repression of the fourth, “hidden/repressed” element; the female. Abrahamic religions, though more specifically Christianity expresses this in its lack of overt feminine symbolism; there is the Virgin Mary but she is the “repressed” fourth aspect of the godhead.</p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="centered"><em>“One becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third comes the One as the fourth.”</em></h3>
            <p class="full">Four represents earth, flesh, matter, feeling, emotion, femininity. Whereas three exemplified a conscious masculine principal, four is the “wholeness” that emerges from the disillusionment with the inferior trinity. Therefore while four at first symbolizes a descent into the labyrinth of the unconscious, it is here where one discovers the “repressed” aspects and brings them forth. Excluding Christianity, quaternaries are important, and nearly universal spiritual/religious symbols. Four expresses a symmetrically circular roundness, therefore it is related to both the mandala and echoes zero. Yet, the problem of the three versus the four is still a prevalent subconscious problem to many in the western world, an issue of the tension of opposing forces.</p>

        <h4>6 (Six) –</h4>
        <div>
            <p class="full">Six symbolizes another descent into darkness before the discovery of the divine element. It has been taken to symbolize Lucifer, though Lucifer need not necessarily be seen as an embodiment of evil, since he is conterminous with the figure of Prometheus.<br><br>
            In this way Six represents humanity as a whole. It is the perfect number within the decad: 1+2+3=6. It is the most productive of all numbers.<br><br>
            Six is the symbol of luck; love; health; beauty; chance. It is a winning number at the throw of the dice in the West.<br><br>
            There are six rays of the solar wheel and there are six interlaced triangles. There are six pointed stars or Seal of Solomon - and Star of David.</p>

        <h4>7 (Seven) –</h4>
        <div>
            <p class="full">As Seven is the solution to 3+4, then seven is the solution to the presented problem. The center of the spiral is humanity's connection to its source, god, Christ consciousness - or whatever name you prefer. It is a conjuncture of even and odd – therefore it represents a union of opposites.<br><br>
            There are seven days in a week, seven musical notes to a diatonic scale. In all cultures, myths and legends seven represents... completeness and totality,<br><br>
            macrocosm, perfection, plenty, reintegration, rest, security, safety, and synthesis.<br><br>
            It symbolizes union of polarity, the hermaphrodite being represented by the two interlaced triangles, the upward- pointing as male, fire and the heavens, and the downward-pointing as female, the waters and the earth.</p>

            <p>Nine is a esoteric number which broadly symbolises awakening. This awakening can be to any truth whether based in reality or spiritual. Often there is a shock to this awakening as it appears to destroy one’s previous conceptions about life. But it is from this seemingly desolate state that a renewal of life emerges; a selfless devotion to a higher truth. Therefore nine also vibrates with individuality, inner wisdom, genius, tolerance, and understanding. In Chinese Feng Shui the number 9 is associated with fire, perhaps both a fire of human power in the Promethean sense, and dually fire as a destructive element. \</p>
