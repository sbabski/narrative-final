                <h1>Myositis</h1>
                <p>Myositis refers to any condition causing inflammation in muscles. Weakness, swelling, and pain are the most common myositis symptoms. Myositis causes include infection, injury, autoimmune conditions, and drug side effects. Treatment of myositis varies according to the cause.</p>

                <h2>Causes of Myositis</h2>
                <p>Myositis is caused by any condition that leads to inflammation in the muscles. Myositis causes can be divided into several categories:</p>

                <h2>Inflammatory conditions</h2>
                <p>Conditions causing inflammation throughout the body may affect the muscles, causing myositis. Many of these causes are autoimmune conditions, in which the body attacks its own tissues. Inflammatory conditions causing potentially severe myositis include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dermatomyositis</li>
                    <li>Polymyositis</li>
                    <li>Inclusion body myositis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other inflammatory conditions tend to cause milder forms of myositis, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lupus</li>
                    <li>Scleroderma</li>
                    <li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Inflammatory conditions are often the most serious myositis causes, requiring long-term treatment.</p>
